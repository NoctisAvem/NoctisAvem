- 👋 Hi, I’m @NoctisAvem, a EU based GEN-X F, trying to get the hang of c0d3 and anything IT and business related. 
- 👀 I’m interested in aquiring knowledge about programming, data analysis, machine learning, ERP systems, cloud solutions, IoT, stock markets etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about pointclouds and when the chance arises, I also plan to explore UE5 and photogrammetry in general. I tinkered a bit with Python and plan to further gain some understanding about cloud services, ERP systems and general IT related info. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for people to collaborate/co-learn with me about any topic related to programming, especially if it's used with data analytics, visualisation or specific scientific pursuits. Lately I've become interested in learning about VR, AR, UE too. As a beginner in all of this, it has become a tough decission, where to put my emphasis on.
- 📫 How to reach me: through GITHub - I guess you are already here (unless you're apt performing some Schroedinger's cat tricks).
