- 👋 Hi, I’m @NoctisAvem, a EU based GEN-X F, trying to get a hang of c0d3, anything IT and business related, 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning use of ERP systems, programming, data analysis/science, machine learning, cloud computing, IoT, RF, stock investment, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Python, use of GITHub, cloud services, ERP systems and general basic to mid-level IT related info.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to Python, especially if used with data analytics or specific scientific pursuits.
- 📫 How to reach me: through GITHub - I guess you are already here (unless you're apt performing some Schroedinger's cat tricks), on Sound Cloud look for SPACE CAT (the one with red&yellow hues), and on Pinterest for Kreia Darth Traya... or simply write to my GITHub' username (use a dot) at GMX.
