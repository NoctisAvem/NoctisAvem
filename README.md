- 👋 Hi, I’m @NoctisAvem, a EU based GEN-X F, trying to get the hang of c0d3 and anything IT and business related. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning use of ERP systems, programming, data analysis/science, machine learning, cloud solutions, IoT, RF, stocks etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Python, cloud services, ERP systems and general basic to mid-level IT related info.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate/co-learn on my level about anything related to Python, especially if it's used with data analytics, visualisation or specific scientific pursuits.
- 📫 How to reach me: through GITHub - I guess you are already here (unless you're apt performing some Schroedinger's cat tricks), on Sound Cloud look for SPACE CAT (the one with red&yellow hues), and on Pinterest for Kreia Darth Traya... or simply write to my GITHub' username (use a dot) at GMX.
